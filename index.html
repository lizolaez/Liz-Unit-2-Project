                <p> Immigration is the moving to a country in which one is not a citizen.
Some people emigrate for work, better education, economic opportunities, or to be with family. Other people migrate due to safety, escaping conflics, terrorism, or human rights violations. More reasons could be climate change, natural disasters, or other environmental factors. </p>

                <!--Add text, images, and links for section 2 below!-->
                <p>When imigrating, one can face struggles. When reaching the destination, there are often difficulties in accessing health care, housing, education or employment. Also, not knowing the language can make it hard to do anything. Immigrants become targets for abuse.

</h2>

                <p> When making their location, people might face getting rober, kidnaped or even raped.  During their trip, they could run out of food, water and medicines which would eventually lead to them getting sick, or possibly dying. Traveling is not safe for anyone, especially not for immigrants who are sometimes seen as threats or discriminated against.
